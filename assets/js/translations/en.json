  "pqr_answer": "At CIOM, what you will find is: The methodology, the tools, the knowledge, and the capability to achieve the improvements that will grow your business. But it is you who knows what needs to be improved for your business to grow. You can use CIOM to improve in two ways:",
  "pqr_answer_li": "a) As a management tool to improve through indicators",
  "pqr_answer_li_2": "b) As an on-demand operational force to perform your tasks",
  "pqr_question_2": "How does CIOM help me improve my indicators?<span class='custom-accordion-icon'>&#x25BC;</span>",
  "pqr_answer_2_li": "(1) It provides you with a tool to have SIMPLE and DYNAMIC indicators",
  "pqr_answer_2_li_1": "(2) It allows your team, suppliers, or third parties to take measurements to feed the indicators.",
  "pqr_answer_2_li_2": "(3) It lets you easily see opportunities for improvement.",
  "pqr_answer_2_li_3": "(4) The platform has the capability to inform those responsible about their opportunities.",
  "pqr_question_3": "Between Audit and Inspection, what would you recommend?<span class='custom-accordion-icon'>&#x25BC;</span>",
  "pqr_answer_3": "Inspections are much friendlier. While they may generate a bit more anxiety in the team because they cannot provide feedback, they ultimately eliminate the bigger stress of having the responsible person feel bad throughout the audit process. From our perspective, inspections are more objective, simple, dynamic, and allow the team to focus on opportunities for improvement rather than on explanations or justifications for why things are not as they should be. Both will help your company improve.",
  "pqr_question_4": "What is the difference between Audit and Inspection?<span class='custom-accordion-icon'>&#x25BC;</span>",
  "pqr_answer_4": "An Audit is usually a bit deeper or more incisive. In an Audit, the responsible person is generally asked to accompany the Auditor during the Audit to see the opportunities and take note of improvements to be made. Inspection, on the other hand, gives the inspector freedom to review independently and produce the necessary information. In this way, the inspector can identify opportunities more quickly and simply so that the responsible person and the team can later learn about the opportunities found.",
  "pqr_question_5": "What does Measure | Correct | Improve consist of?<span class='custom-accordion-icon'>&#x25BC;</span>",
  "pqr_answer_5": "This is the methodology widely used by successful companies. It involves identifying a critical variable for your business and creating an indicator that will allow you to manage towards the necessary improvement for your company’s growth. These indicators are fed by information that may come from measurements or from your own system.",
  "pqr_question_6": "Do I need to use CIOM?<span class='custom-accordion-icon'>&#x25BC;</span>",
  "pqr_answer_6_li": "If you have initiatives that you cannot carry out due to lack of time, money, or capacity",
  "pqr_answer_6_li_1": "If your management indicators are all above 90% effectiveness.",
  "pqr_answer_6_li_2": "If everything seems to be fine, but you know that not everything is right",
  "pqr_answer_6_li_3": "If you believe you have vanity metrics",
  "pqr_answer_6_li_4": "CIOM is the next step in the growth of your company",
  "pqr_question_7": "What is the use of an on-demand operational force?<span class='custom-accordion-icon'>&#x25BC;</span>",
  "pqr_answer_7": "There are surely countless initiatives that you cannot carry out due to time, money, geography, climate, etc. An on-demand operational force with today’s technology capabilities allows you to have that extra hand whenever you need it. Bring your ideas to life, invest in Crowdsourcing, and forget about hiring, firing, and managing staff.",
  "pqr_question_8": "When to use Crowdsourcing?<span class='custom-accordion-icon'>&#x25BC;</span>",
  "pqr_answer_8_li": "When you want your team to stop having the difficult task of being Judge and Party.",
  "pqr_answer_8_li_1": "If you need more objectivity and impartiality in measurements.",

  "pqr_answer_9_li_1": "The operational stress of leading, supervising, and performing measurements/surveys disappears.",
  "pqr_answer_9_li_2": "You develop a network of suppliers that will allow you to achieve operational levels never thought possible.",
  "pqr_question_10": "What is the disadvantage of the Crowdsourcing model?<span class='custom-accordion-icon'>&#x25BC;</span>",
  "pqr_answer_10": "Since the person measuring/surveying is external, they are not affected by the result. This makes the data objective, cold, and direct. This can be stressful at first for organizations that were used to measuring internally, where the...",
  "pqr_question_11": "Will these people work for me?<span class='custom-accordion-icon'>&#x25BC;</span>",
  "pqr_answer_11": "According to all principles, NO. The platform makes available tasks for you and all other companies. They are service providers who do not come into contact with you. Additionally, unless necessary or specified, the people do not know for whom they are performing the task.",
